	our class to any new Foods object that we make.

/*now we see it in action.
remember that this is all syntactical sugar to hide 
the fact that JS is actually implementing prototypal inheritance.
I heard Crockford argue that this is a mistake and that it 
lets Java programmers act like JS has classical inheritance, leaving them
forever in ignorance to the prototypal chain. From my noob standpoint
it just feels like less boilerplate code and is easier to write.

so we create a new object. Notice that we could pass in 
3 arguments if we wanted to define our object specifically
example... let user1 = new Foods('durian', 'tropics' 300)
*/
let user1 = new Foods();
//we run the function increment() which was automatically inherited
user1.increment();
//console table shows us that the user1 rating increased by 1. 
console.table(user1);





/*this way is perfectly fine, but.. the above way with 
javascript classes gives you the same stuff with a lot less 
boilerplate code.*/
function player(name, score) {
	let newPlayer = Object.create(playerFunctionStore);
	newPlayer.name = name;
	newPlayer.score = score;
	return newPlayer;
};

let playerFunctionStore = {
	increment: function() {this.score++; return this.score;},
	login: function() {console.log('is here to stay');},
}
let player2 = player('tim', 5);
let player1 = player('will', 3);
player1.increment()
console.table(player2)
console.table(player1) //notice that the score increased by 1.
